# GORISIM
This program is a Turkish sign language translator.

The Turkish Sign Language Translator project is an innovative and comprehensive program that combines deep learning, computer vision, and speech processing techniques to bridge the communication gap between the deaf community and the hearing world. By leveraging state-of-the-art technologies, this project aims to provide an intuitive and efficient solution for real-time translation of Turkish sign language gestures into spoken or written language.

Using a combination of machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, the program analyzes video input of Turkish sign language gestures captured through a camera. The deep learning models trained on large sign language datasets enable the system to recognize and interpret the intricate hand movements, facial expressions, and body postures that form the basis of Turkish sign language.

The computer vision component of the project employs advanced techniques such as object detection, pose estimation, and hand tracking to accurately capture and interpret the sign language gestures in real time. By precisely tracking the user's hand movements and mapping them to the corresponding sign language symbols, the system ensures accurate translation and interpretation.

To enhance the translation capabilities, the project incorporates speech processing algorithms that convert the interpreted sign language gestures into spoken language. The system uses natural language processing techniques to generate human-readable text from the interpreted sign language, enabling users to understand the meaning behind the gestures through audio output. Additionally, the program can also display the translated text on a screen or interface for better comprehension.

The Turkish Sign Language Translator project aims to be an inclusive and accessible solution that promotes effective communication between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who are not familiar with sign language. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, it seeks to empower the deaf community by providing them with a tool to express themselves more easily and effectively in various settings, including educational institutions, public spaces, and everyday conversations.

The project is open-source and hosted on GitHub to encourage collaboration and further development by the community. It welcomes contributions from researchers, developers, and sign language experts who are passionate about creating inclusive technologies. With ongoing advancements in deep learning, computer vision, and speech processing, the Turkish Sign Language Translator project holds great potential for improving communication accessibility and fostering inclusivity in society.
